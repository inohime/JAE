Hello! Thanks for checking out JAE! uwu

This is a style guide for how things work/ are styled specifically in JAE & Hinode.
-------------------

1.) Private member variables are prefixed with underscores "_{variable-name}."

2.) Aliases must be prefixed with "I" and held in the System namespace "I{typename}."
	3A.) Do not add it to the sharedtypes.hpp file unless the entire engine utilizes it or it's a core type.

3.) Function Arguments/Parameters are camelCased "StudentName(char *firstName, char *lastName);"

4.) Function names are PascalCased "SetStudentGPA(int gpa)."
	A.) If the function name contains an abbreviation ("FBI", "GPA", "IDE") it must always be capitalized.

5.) Function names must stay simple, ALWAYS.
	A.) Extensions of the engine are not subject to this rule unless applied to the core.

6.) Curly braces start on the (declaration/definition)'s first line.

7.) Implementation defined headers are included first (<>), local directory headers are included after ("").
	A.) SDL headers are excluded from this.
